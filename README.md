https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page
NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) has collected trip data which includes fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts. For this analysis, data from  yellow Taxi has been collected for a duration of 6 months (~7 GB â€“ 98 million rows). However, due to resource limitations, only one month of ~ 2GB (14 million) of data was used
